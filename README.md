The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Java-based desktop application that aims to simplify and enhance the administration of essential hospital operations. Designed with Java Swing for an interactive interface and MySQL for data storage, HMS provides a structured platform for managing patient information, room availability, employee records, and other critical resources. By organizing these processes within one secure system, HMS reduces manual tasks, improves accuracy, and fosters seamless communication across departments.
Key functionalities include patient registration and discharge, room management, and employee tracking, all accessible through an intuitive dashboard. Staff can use the system to register new patients, view and update records, check real-time room availability, and assign roles to employees. Additionally, HMS offers modules for tracking ambulance availability and departmental contacts, giving users quick access to essential hospital resources. The systemâ€™s secure login feature ensures data privacy and session integrity, supporting safe and efficient access to information.
Built for scalability, HMS is designed with future enhancements in mind, including advanced search filters, multi-user role access, and detailed reporting capabilities. These planned upgrades aim to improve data retrieval, enhance decision-making, and provide comprehensive insights into hospital operations. Through this combination of core functionalities and potential expansions, HMS presents a valuable solution for modern hospitals, contributing to improved resource management, operational efficiency, and patient care quality
